# flow

> Reusable multi-agent workflows, CodeRabbit-style code audit, and tmux visualization — **making workflows simple.**

`flow` lets you describe a multi-agent workflow in ~15 lines of YAML (three knobs: **agents**, **phases**, **loops**) and run it end-to-end with no human gates. It also ships battle-tested plan/implement/audit skills and live tmux visualization of every agent.

It unifies `pair`'s plan/implement/review simplicity with `@quintinshaw/pi-dynamic-workflows`' dynamic orchestration and a CodeRabbit-style audit rigor, plus tmux panes adapted from `team`. It coexists with `pair` and will eventually deprecate `team`.

---

## The mental model (read this first)

Flow has **three layers**, kept deliberately separate. Confusing them is the #1 source of confusion, so here is the whole picture:

| Layer | What it is | Where it lives | Who writes it |
|-------|------------|----------------|---------------|
| **Agent** | A role's *behavior* — a system prompt + frontmatter (`tools`, `thinking`, …). **Never carries a `model:`** — the model is supplied at dispatch. | `~/.pi/agent/agents/<name>.md` (global) or `.pi/agents/<name>.md` (project overrides global) | flow ships **6 defaults**; you edit/add freely (write-once) |
| **Workflow** | *What runs, in what order* — either a built-in skill (Tier 1) or a YAML file (Tier 2). | Tier 1: built-in skills · Tier 2: `.pi/workflows/<name>.yaml` | flow ships skills + **4 example YAMLs**; you add YAMLs |
| **Config** | *Runtime settings* — which model an agent runs on, audit thresholds, tmux, worktree. | `~/.pi/sf/flow/config.json` (global) + `.pi/sf/flow/config.json` (project) | you (partial is fine) |

> ### ⚠️ Config does NOT define agents or workflows
> The **reviewer is defined as an agent** (`~/.pi/agent/agents/reviewer.md`) and **used by** the plan/implement/audit skills. `config.json` only sets **which model** that reviewer runs on (plus `audit` / `tmux` / `worktree` settings). The reviewer's *behavior* lives in the `.md` file — config never describes how an agent thinks.
>
> Concretely: `{"reviewer":{"model":"anthropic/sonnet-4-6"}}` means *"run the reviewer agent (already defined) on Sonnet 4.6"* — it does **not** create the reviewer.

**Where the model comes from, per tier:**

- **Tier 1 skills** (`sf_flow_plan` / `sf_flow_implement` / `sf_flow_audit`) — the reviewer model is resolved from `config.json` via a [4-step chain](#configuration) (prompt → config → env → ask).
- **Tier 2 YAML flows** — each agent sets its `model:` **inline in the YAML** (a fuzzy alias like `sonnet` or `haiku`), independent of `config.json`. Config has no say here.

---

## Installation

```bash
pi install npm:@pi-stef/flow
```

Flow's skills are discovered natively via `pi.skills`. To author flows that pull from Jira/PRDs, also install `@pi-stef/atlassian`.

---

## Quickstart

```bash
# 1. Audit your current diff — zero config, runs the 7-angle triad + dual-blind gate
/sf-flow-audit

# 2. Plan, then implement a feature (reviewer model from config.json)
/sf-flow-plan add OAuth login
/sf-flow-implement 2026-07-20-oauth-login

# 3. Define a reusable flow in ~15 lines of YAML, then run it end-to-end
cp node_modules/@pi-stef/flow/workflows/code-review.yaml .pi/workflows/   # or write your own
sf_flow_auto code-review "review the auth changes"
```

You can also drive everything in natural language:

```
"Plan a feature for adding user authentication, use anthropic/sonnet-4-6 as reviewer"
"Implement the plan in ai_plan/2026-07-20-oauth-login"
"Run the code-review flow on the staged diff"
```

---

## Built-in agents

Six write-once agent definitions ship in `packages/flow/agents/` and are copied to your **global** discovery dir (`~/.pi/agent/agents/`) on first use of a Tier 1 skill:

| Agent | Role | `tools` | `thinking` |
|-------|------|---------|-----------|
| `planner` | Workflow Planner — milestones + stories | read, grep, find, ls | medium |
| `explorer` | Codebase Explorer — read-only research | read, grep, find, ls | low |
| `developer` | TDD Developer — red/green/refactor | read, grep, find, ls, write, bash | medium |
| `reviewer` | Plan/Implementation Reviewer | read, grep, find, ls | high |
| `auditor` | Code Auditor (CodeRabbit-style) | read, grep, find, ls | high |
| `synth` | Synthesis / Report Writer | read, write | medium |

- **Write-once:** flow *never* overwrites an existing agent file, so you can edit any of them freely.
- **No `model:` in the file:** the model is resolved at dispatch time (Tier 1: from `config.json`; Tier 2: from the YAML's inline `model:`).
- **Project overrides global:** a `<repo>/.pi/agents/reviewer.md` shadows the global one (pi-subagents semantics).

**Add a new agent:** just drop a `<name>.md` at `~/.pi/agent/agents/` (global) or `.pi/agents/` (project), then reference it by name in a workflow's `agents:` block. `sf_flow_create_workflow` will also write a write-once stub for any agent you declare that doesn't yet exist.

---

## Built-in workflows (examples)

Four reference flows ship in `packages/flow/workflows/`. They are **not** auto-loaded — copy the one you want into your project to use it:

| Workflow | File | What it does |
|----------|------|--------------|
| `code-review` | `code-review.yaml` | CodeRabbit-style review of a diff (audit triad) |
| `ship-feature` | `ship-feature.yaml` | Plan → implement → audit a feature, gated until `APPROVED` |
| `auth-audit` | `auth-audit.yaml` | Scan route files, fan out audits, dedup, synthesize a report |
| `research-report` | `research-report.yaml` | Multi-perspective research with cross-checking + synthesis |

```bash
cp node_modules/@pi-stef/flow/workflows/ship-feature.yaml .pi/workflows/
sf_flow_auto ship-feature "add a rate limiter to the API"
```

---

## Tier 1 — the built-in skills

Five prose skills (fixed, battle-tested step sequences) plus a worktree helper:

| Skill | Slash | Tool | Purpose |
|-------|-------|------|---------|
| Plan | `/sf-flow-plan` | `sf_flow_plan` | Multi-milestone plan with **parallel** research + iterative review |
| Implement | `/sf-flow-implement` | `sf_flow_implement` | One worktree, TDD per story, **audit gate** before commit |
| Audit | `/sf-flow-audit` | `sf_flow_audit` | CodeRabbit-style audit (7 angles + dual-blind AND-gate + fix-apply) |
| Auto | `/sf-flow-auto` | `sf_flow_auto` | Run any defined flow end-to-end, no human gates |
| Create Workflow | `/sf-flow-create-workflow` | `sf_flow_create_workflow` | Wizard: interview → agents/phases/loops YAML → `/<name>` |
| — | — | `sf_flow_finalize` | Remove a flow worktree dir, preserve its branch |

### sf_flow_plan

Create a multi-milestone implementation plan with parallel research and iterative reviewer approval. Produces `ai_plan/<slug>/`.

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `prompt` | No | The task to plan |
| `reviewer_model` | No | Override reviewer model (else [4-step chain](#configuration)) |
| `explorer_model` | No | Override explorer model (inherits parent if unset) |

Phases: (1) fan out N explorers in parallel → codebase map; (2) gather requirements one question at a time; (3) design via brainstorming; (4) plan via writing-plans (milestones + `S-MN{seq}` stories); (5) iterative reviewer loop (fix P0/P1/P2, max 10 rounds); (6) write plan files; (7) optional Telegram notify.

### sf_flow_implement

Execute an approved plan in **one** worktree (`flow/<slug>`, git-only), TDD per story, with the audit triad as a **non-optional gate** before commit.

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `path` | Yes | Plan folder slug or path under `ai_plan/` |
| `reviewer_model` | No | Override reviewer model |

Per-milestone loop: TDD each story → reviewer loop → commit to the worktree branch → update the tracker. After all milestones: run `sf_flow_audit` on the accumulated diff; on `REVISE` (any P0/P1/P2) loop back to the failing **story** (not the whole plan), bounded by `audit.max_rounds` (default 5). Finish with `sf_flow_finalize` (removes the worktree dir, preserves the `flow/<slug>` branch for a PR).

### sf_flow_audit

CodeRabbit-style audit returning P0–P3 findings + a verdict (`APPROVED` / `REVISE`). See the [audit triad](#code-audit-triad) below.

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `target` | No | Diff target: a git ref range, a file path, or `workdir`. Defaults to `git diff HEAD` (staged + unstaged) |
| `reviewer_model` | No | Override reviewer model |
| `apply_fixes` | No | If true, run respond-review to apply must-fix / should-fix |

### sf_flow_auto

Run a defined flow end-to-end with **no human gates**.

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `workflow` | Yes | Flow name (matches `.pi/workflows/<name>.yaml`) |
| `input` | Yes | `prompt` · path to a markdown file · `prd:<path>` · `jira STORY-123` |

Input forms: `prompt` (verbatim), `md-file` (file contents), `prd:<path>` (parsed PRD), `jira STORY-123` (resolved via `@pi-stef/atlassian`). Phases run sequentially; intra-phase fan-out via `parallel()`; loops run to a terminal state (success / no-op / blocked / exhausted).

### sf_flow_create_workflow

Turn intent into a validated flow. Interviews you one question at a time (skip if you pass all params), writes `.pi/workflows/<name>.yaml`, emits write-once agent stubs for any new agents, validates with `validateFlowYaml`, and registers `/<name>`.

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | No | kebab-case flow name |
| `description` | No | One-liner |
| `input` | No | `prompt` / `md-file` / `prd` / `jira` |
| `agents_yaml` | No | Pre-formed agents YAML to skip the interview |
| `phases_yaml` | No | Pre-formed phases YAML |
| `loops_yaml` | No | Pre-formed loops YAML |

### sf_flow_finalize

Remove a flow worktree directory while **preserving** its branch. Call after `sf_flow_implement` finishes.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `worktree_path` | string | Absolute path of the flow worktree to remove |

---

## Tier 2 — declarative YAML flows (the 3-knob model)

This is the heart of flow. Describe a workflow with three knobs and the generator compiles it into a pi-dynamic-workflows script.

```yaml
# .pi/workflows/auth-audit.yaml
name: auth-audit
description: Audit auth coverage across route files
input: prompt
agents:
  scanner: { tools: [read, grep, find], model: haiku, thinking: low }
  auditor: { tools: [read, grep, find], model: sonnet, thinking: high, isolated: true,
             schema: { verdict: "APPROVED|REVISE" } }
  synth:   { tools: [read, write], model: sonnet }
phases:
  - { id: scan,   agent: scanner,  prompt: "List every route file under src/routes/.", out: files }
  - { id: audit,  agent: auditor,  fanout: files, prompt: "Audit {{item}} for missing auth checks.", out: findings }
  - { id: verify, agent: auditor,  verify: findings, threshold: 0.66, out: confirmed }
  - { id: report, agent: synth,    in: confirmed, prompt: "Write a cited report from these findings." }
loops:
  audit: { until_dry: true, max_rounds: 3, dedup_key: "{{file}}:{{line}}:{{summary}}" }
```

Run it: `sf_flow_auto auth-audit "check the API routes"`.

### Knob 1 — `agents`

A map of agent-name → definition. Each agent's *behavior* comes from its `.md` file (by name); the YAML only adds runtime config:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `tools` | `string[]` | Tools the agent may use (e.g. `[read, grep, find]`) |
| `model` | `string` | Fuzzy model alias (`haiku`, `sonnet`, `opus`, …) resolved by pi-dw. **Independent of `config.json`** |
| `thinking` | `enum` | `off` · `minimal` · `low` · `medium` · `high` · `xhigh` · `max` |
| `isolated` | `boolean` | Spawn in a fresh context (no parent conversation) |
| `schema` | `object` | Structured output contract, e.g. `{ verdict: "APPROVED|REVISE" }` (required for `until: approved` loops) |

### Knob 2 — `phases`

An ordered list. **Each phase runs exactly one of** `agent` / `skill` / `raw`:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `id` | `string` | Phase identifier (referenced by `loops`) |
| `agent` | `string` | Run an agent (must be declared in `agents`) |
| `skill` | `string` | Run a built-in skill (e.g. `sf-flow-audit`) — opaque to the generator |
| `raw` | `string` | Run a raw pi-dw snippet — opaque to the generator |
| `prompt` | `string` | Prompt template; the fanout item and prior `out` vars are interpolated (see examples) |
| `fanout` | `string` | Iterate a list — a prior phase's `out` var or an `args.*` runtime input (agent phases only) |
| `verify` | `string` | Cross-check a prior `out`; pass when `>= threshold` of items survive |
| `threshold` | `number` | Verify pass ratio (default per flow) |
| `in` | `string \| string[]` | Feed prior `out`(s) into this phase |
| `out` | `string` | Name this phase's output (referenced by later phases / `fanout` / `verify`) |

### Knob 3 — `loops`

A map of phase-id → loop. Two kinds:

| Field | Applies to | Description |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| `until_dry` | discovery | Keep running the phase until it stops finding new things. **Requires `fanout`.** Optional `dedup_key` (a template over item fields, e.g. `file:line`) and `consecutive_empty` (stop after N empty rounds) |
| `until` | gate | `until: approved` — run until the agent's `schema.verdict` is `APPROVED`. **Requires the agent to declare a verdict `schema`** |
| `fail_on` | gate | Severities that block: `[P0, P1, P2]` (default) |
| `max_rounds` | both | Bound on iterations (default per flow) |

### Validation rules

`validateFlowYaml` enforces these cross-field rules so a loop/fanout is never silently swallowed (invalid flows fail at registration, not at runtime):

| # | Rule |
|---|------|
| 1 | Each phase sets **exactly one** of `agent` / `skill` / `raw` |
| 2 | `agent` must reference a name declared in `agents` |
| 3 | `fanout` is allowed **only** on agent phases (skill/raw are opaque) |
| 4 | `fanout` **requires** `out` (parallel results must be captured) |
| 5 | `verify` must reference a **prior** phase's `out` |
| 6 | `out` names must be **unique** across phases |
| 7 | `loops.<phaseId>` must reference an existing phase |
| 8 | Loops are **not** allowed on `skill` phases |
| 9 | Loops are **not** allowed on `raw` phases |
| 10 | `until_dry` **requires** the phase to set `fanout` |
| 11 | `until: approved` **requires** the phase agent to declare a `schema.verdict` |

### Defining a new flow

Two paths to the same result (a `.pi/workflows/<name>.yaml` runnable via `sf_flow_auto`):

- **Wizard** — invoke `/sf-flow-create-workflow` and answer one question at a time. It writes the YAML, emits any missing agent stubs, validates, and registers `/<name>`.
- **By hand** — create `.pi/workflows/<name>.yaml` following the schema above (or copy an example from `packages/flow/workflows/`). Run `sf_flow_create_workflow` once to validate + register `/<name>`, or just run `sf_flow_auto <name> <input>` directly (it validates + generates eagerly).

---

## Code audit triad

`sf_flow_audit` runs four modules sharing a P0–P3 + verdict contract. `VERDICT: APPROVED` only when no P0/P1/P2 remain.

| Module | What it does |
|--------|--------------|
| **codereview** | Wraps pi-dw `/code-review`: **7 finder angles** (A/B/C correctness medium-tier, D/E/F cleanup small-tier, G altitude big-tier). Each finding is verified 3-way (CONFIRMED / PLAUSIBLE / REFUTED — REFUTED dropped), deduped by `file:line:summary`, ranked correctness > cleanup > altitude. Diffs cap at `MAX_DIFF_CHARS` (200000). |
| **auditcode** | A **10-section** self-checklist (Supply Chain & Security, Provenance & Metadata, Law of Demeter, …). `gateExitCode` returns 1 on any failure; `qualityScore = 100*(total − must − should)/total`. |
| **requestreview** | Santa-method **dual-blind AND-gate**: two independent reviewers (neither sees the other) must **both** pass (`mustFix == 0 && score >= threshold`). Bounded by `MAX_REVIEW_ITERATIONS` (5); a 6th iteration is forbidden. |
| **respondreview** | `categorize` (P0/P1 must-fix, P2 should-fix, P3 consider) + `applyOrder` (severity rank). If `apply_fixes`, applies in order then re-runs test/typecheck/lint. Hard gate: every finding is addressed (fix, disagree+document, or clarify). |

Output is rendered via `renderReport` in pair's `### P0…P3` + `## Verdict` format.

---

## tmux visualization

When enabled, each spawned agent gets its own tmux pane, driven by pi-dw's event stream (`subagents:created` opens a pane; `subagents:completed` / `subagents:failed` close it). Two themes:

| Theme | Style |
|-------|-------|
| `codex` (default) | ANSI status colors |
| `plain` | No escape codes (for logs / piped output) |

Escape hatches: `SF_FLOW_NO_TMUX=1` or `tmux.enabled=false`. When disabled, the renderer is a byte-identical no-op (`NOOP_WHEN_DISABLED`). Sessions are named `sf-flow-<hex>` and adoption is name-guarded so flow only touches its own sessions.

---

## Configuration

Config is **layered**: project `.pi/sf/flow/config.json` is merged over global `~/.pi/sf/flow/config.json`, both over defaults. Partial configs are fine — anything you omit falls back to its default.

```json
{
  "reviewer": { "model": "anthropic/sonnet-4-6" },
  "explorer": { "model": "anthropic/haiku-4-5" },
  "audit": { "threshold": 0.94, "max_rounds": 5 },
  "tmux": { "enabled": true, "theme": "codex" },
  "worktree": { "branch_prefix": "flow/" }
}
```

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `reviewer.model` | `string` | — | Model for the reviewer agent (Tier 1 skills). **Required** for plan/implement/audit unless given per-call |
| `explorer.model` | `string` | — | Model for the explorer agent (inherits parent if unset) |
| `audit.threshold` | `number` | `0.94` | Dual-blind AND-gate pass score |
| `audit.max_rounds` | `integer` | `5` | Max audit fix-loop iterations |
| `tmux.enabled` | `boolean` | `true` | Render agent panes |
| `tmux.theme` | `codex` \| `plain` | `codex` | Pane style |
| `worktree.branch_prefix` | `string` | `flow/` | Branch prefix for implement worktrees |

**Environment variables:** `SF_FLOW_REVIEWER_MODEL`, `SF_FLOW_EXPLORER_MODEL`, `SF_FLOW_NO_TMUX=1`.

### Model resolution chain (Tier 1 skills)

**Reviewer model** (required for plan/implement/audit):

1. Prompt argument — e.g. `"use anthropic/sonnet-4-6 as reviewer"`
2. Config file — `reviewer.model` (project, then global)
3. Environment — `SF_FLOW_REVIEWER_MODEL`
4. Ask the user (the tool returns a "not configured" message if all else fails)

**Explorer model** (optional, plan only): prompt → config → env → **inherits the parent (session) model**.

> Note: Tier 2 YAML agents ignore this chain — they use the inline `model:` field in the YAML.

---

## Architecture

### Skill-driven design

The five tools are thin: each resolves config + ensures agents exist, then hands off to a `SKILL.md` containing the actual step sequence. The extension provides only config loading, model resolution, write-once agent templates, and worktree helpers.

### Agent spawning

Agents run as pi-subagents from global definitions at `~/.pi/agent/agents/<name>.md`. Files are write-once and omit `model:` — flow resolves the model and passes it at dispatch (`Agent({ subagent_type: "reviewer", model: "<id>" })`).

### Worktree lifecycle (implement)

1. Create one git worktree with branch `flow/<slug>` (git-only; non-git targets skip it).
2. Per milestone: TDD each story → reviewer loop → commit to the worktree branch → update the tracker.
3. Audit gate on the accumulated diff; on `REVISE`, loop back to the failing story (bounded by `audit.max_rounds`).
4. `sf_flow_finalize` removes the worktree directory while preserving the `flow/<slug>` branch for a PR.

---

## Plan-folder layout

```
ai_plan/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>/
├── original-plan.md         # Raw approved plan
├── final-transcript.md      # Conversation log
├── milestone-plan.md        # Full specification
├── story-tracker.md         # Status tracking
└── continuation-runbook.md  # Resume context
```

`ai_plan/` is gitignored.

---

## Migration from team

`flow` replaces `team`'s tmux visualization + dynamic dispatch + audit on the pi-subagents / pi-dynamic-workflows foundation — **without** subprocess orchestration or milestone/story parallel lanes (deliberately dropped).

| `team` | `flow` |
|--------|--------|
| plan / implement | `sf_flow_plan` / `sf_flow_implement` |
| audit | `sf_flow_audit` |
| user-defined workflows | Tier 2 YAML flows via `sf_flow_create_workflow` + `sf_flow_auto` |
| tmux visualization | built-in (`tmux.enabled`) |
| subprocess orchestration | dropped (pi-subagents instead) |
| parallel lanes | dropped |

`flow` is self-contained — it imports neither `@pi-stef/team` nor `@pi-stef/agent-workflows` — so deprecating `team` later cannot break it.

---

## Key differences from pair

| Feature | `pair` | `flow` |
|---------|--------|--------|
| Plan research | Single explorer | Fleet of parallel explorers |
| Implement gate | Reviewer loop | Reviewer loop **+ audit triad** |
| Custom workflows | — | Tier 2 YAML (agents/phases/loops) |
| Code audit | — | CodeRabbit-style triad (`sf_flow_audit`) |
| tmux visualization | — | Built-in |
| Foundation | pi-subagents | pi-subagents + pi-dynamic-workflows |
